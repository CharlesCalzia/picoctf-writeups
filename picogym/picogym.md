# PicoGym Exclusive

## First find

Look through subfolders and find uber-secret.txt. Did this manually (took a few seconds) - no need to extract the folder.

## Big Zip

1. Extract the folder (takes some time).

2. Run command: `grep -R "picoCTF{"`, which searches for the string `"picoCTF"` in the folder, returning the text which matches it, showing you the flag.
